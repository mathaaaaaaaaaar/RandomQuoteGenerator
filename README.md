Welcome to the Random Quote Generator, the only app in the universe that can get you out of bed and into a good mood! This simple web application generates random quotes from a vast database (An array that I made) of inspiring quotes...that's pretty much it

## Features

- **Motivate you**: Exactly what you're looking for! With this gloomy winter weather, we all kinda need this to force us out of bed and get to class. For example, it can motivate you to:

  - Go to work, you know, to make money and feed yourself
  - Learn a new skill
  - Do an assignment
  - Meet someone and find love (no promises, that one's kinda on you)

- **Do Nothing**: Only if you're brave enough to not press the button

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (Not the mad scientist type of clone, this is the mad developer type of clone).
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if that's your type, but please don't use yarn).
3. Pray to the coding gods that there are no errors (There are no errors, I made this app, c'mon).
4. Run `npm start`

## Final Words

If this made you laugh (or even a small smirk), consider grading it a 100%
